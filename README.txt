Notepad++ Autocompletion for Python
====
V1.3 - 12 February 2019

Usage
----
This python script generates a custom python.xml file for advanced auto-completion features within Notepad++.
The python.xml file has to be copied in the folder: \Notepad++\plugins\APIs\ (you might rename the existing python.xml file or simply overwrite it).

To use the auto-completion features within Notepad++, enable the option in Settings | Preferences | Backup/Auto-Completion | Enable auto-completion on each input.

As input, I recommend to create a python script containing all public and user-defined modules you usually use, for instance create the following file: my_imports.py and type in:

    import sys, cgi, os, re, subprocess
	import cx_Oracle as oracle
	from rdkit import Chem
	sys.path.append("/home/python/my_python_modules/")
	import my_module

Finally, run the python script:

	python generate_python_autocomplete.py < my_imports.py > python.xml
	
Save the file under \Notepad++\plugins\APIs\python.xml
Restart Notepad++; you're done!

The built-in functions are added by default. Please have a look at the code for additional options (or run `generate_python_autocomplete.py --help`).
